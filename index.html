      <h1>My OSCP Journey — A Review</h1>
      <p>
        This post describes the journey that I went through while studying for the
        Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <p>
        It outlines my personal experience and therefore is very subjective. I don’t
        go into any details about the OSCP labs and exam due to restrictions set by
        Offensive Security. Instead, I’ve structured it in such a way that it gives
        the advice that I wish I had gotten when I first started the certification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="beginnings">
      <h2>When It All Began — Or So I Thought…</h2>

      <p>
        I first enrolled in the OSCP certification at the beginning of last year. I
        had just finished a Master’s degree in Computer Science and started my first
        full time position as a Security Assessment Analyst.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time, I had a background in web security; however, I recognized that
        there was a huge gap in my knowledge of the entire process of penetration
        testing. This is what piqued my interest in the OSCP certification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without doing much research into the prerequisites of the certification, I
        enrolled in the PWK v1.1.6 course and made the incorrect assumption that it
        would be like any other course I had taken.
      </p>

      <p>
        And boy was I wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course material did not go in depth on techniques required to compromise
        a host or escalate privileges. Despite completing most of the exercises, I
        felt completely lost in the labs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between starting a new job and finishing a Master’s degree, I didn’t realize
        how burnt out I already was. I let my lab time (and exam attempt) expire and
        decided to focus on my job.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #1</h3>
      <p>
        I would not recommend enrolling in the OSCP course unless you have previous
        experience with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reconnaissance</li>
        <li>Initial foothold</li>
        <li>Privilege escalation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This experience can come from work or self-study platforms such as Hack The
        Box (HTB).
      </p>

      <h2>Pre-Preparation — TJ_Null’s List to the Rescue!</h2>

      <p>
        Fast forward to the summer of last year, I decided to start studying again
        but was still intent on not extending my lab time until I felt fully
        prepared.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most useful resource I came across was TJ_Null’s list of OSCP-like Hack
        The Box machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around that time, I also led a study group where I designed the syllabus and
        facilitated discussions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each week consisted of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>One chapter from the CompTIA Pentest+ book</li>
        <li>Two Hack The Box machines from TJ_Null’s list</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The group unanimously agreed that the Pentest+ book was not helpful, while
        IppSec’s methodology was invaluable.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began publishing writeups for each box, which helped reinforce my own
        understanding and anticipate questions.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #2</h3>
      <p>
        If you have the time, blog your box writeups. If not, take detailed notes.
        Don’t solve a box and immediately move on.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="labs">
      <h2>OSCP Labs — Second Time’s a Charm</h2>

      <p>
        After completing all 47 boxes, I enrolled in PWK v2 with a one-month lab
        subscription.
      </p>

      <p>
        PWK v2 was a massive improvement over v1. The course material was more
        thorough and assumed less prior knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        I completed the lab report, resulting in a 285-page document, and spent the
        remaining time compromising approximately 25 machines.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #3</h3>
      <p>
        Complete TJ_Null’s list and watch IppSec’s videos. You won’t realize how
        accurate the list is until you start the OSCP labs.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #4</h3>
      <p>
        If possible, enroll in the 3-month lab option. The additional time is
        invaluable for Active Directory and pivoting practice.
      </p>

    <section id="exam">
      <h2>OSCP Exam — The Dreaded 24-Hour Exam</h2>

      <p>
        Before the exam, I did multiple dry runs suggested by the community.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #5</h3>
      <p>
        Doing a dry run helps you refine your methodology and accept that getting
        stuck is part of the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        I scheduled the exam the day before and passed within the first 9.5 hours,
        despite hitting a wall later.
      </p>

      <h3>Advice #6</h3>
      <p>
        Stay calm during the exam. Don’t be afraid to use Metasploit strategically
        when appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within a week of submitting my report, I received confirmation that I passed
        on my first attempt.

      <h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        OSCP is a beginner certification that is achievable with time and effort. If
        you’re struggling, that’s okay — many others have been there too.

      <h2>Commonly Asked Q&amp;A</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>I’m a beginner, how do I get started?</strong>
          <p>
            Start with easy HTB boxes from TJ_Null’s list and learn through repetition
            and guided walkthroughs.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Which service should I enumerate first?</strong>
          <p>
            Scan all TCP and common UDP ports first, then prioritize unusual services
            before common ones like HTTP.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>How do I avoid rabbit holes?</strong>
          <p>
            Develop a checklist per service and move on once you exhaust all
            reasonable vectors.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I struggle with Windows boxes.</strong>
          <p>
            Focus on shell quality and privilege escalation methodology.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>How do I improve at privilege escalation?</strong>
          <p>
            Practice structured enumeration and consider dedicated privesc courses.
